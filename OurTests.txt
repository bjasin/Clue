For the testRooms function, we tested the BedRoom, Pool, Wine Cellar, Dining Room, and Closet.
For the FourDoorDirections function, we tested the that the foyer door opens to the right, the 
TV Room opens to the left, the lounge opens up, and the Kitchen opens down.
There are 14 doorways, so the testNumberOfDoorways reflects that.
